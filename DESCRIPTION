Description: has only one function (so far) which calculate
    adjacency matrix and boolean matrix. This is useful for those 
    who taking uni course related to these. For adjacency matrix calculation,
    this is extreamely slow as it is 1000 times slower than normal multiplication
    by 'expm' if you simulate it for 10,000. There is no problem about 
    speed if you don't use it for huge iteration or recursion.
